# Mechatronics System Group Project - Wafflers
**Project Title:** John Deere Geddes Automated Food Tractor

**Description:** We've built an automated device that senses when food is done via data analysis of temperature behavior. 
Once the cooking process is completed, the device will push the fully cooked substance off of the hot surface. 

### Why did we build this project?

The motivation of this project was to make the cooking process easier for the user by eliminating the need to 
identify when a meal is fully cooked and automating the process of removing food from hot surfaces, 
which presents a safety risk. This effectively decreases the probability of burnt food and 
limits potential safety risks. It also saves the user's time.

> One notable feature of our project is how it initiates movement and temperature sensing based on 
the cooking time specific to a certain food.

### Technologies used:
* Arduino, Arduino IDE, and the buggy as these were resources that had been supplied to us. 
* We chose a Type K thermocouple was due to its reliability, its commonplace use, and its ability to accurately capture a wide range of temperatures.
* We used a hot plate as a heating element because the design includes open sides, giving greater access to the heated surface.

### What did we learn?

**Lexi:** How to work on a team underpressure (while maintaining friendships). 
How to better communicate team learnings especially when team meetings are cut short or not everyone is there. 
Keeping everyone up-to-date which allowed us to stay on track and meet our sprint goals.

**Marta:** Gained a good idea of how integration works (specifically designing mechanical parts to accommodate for electrical parts.)

**Ava:** I learned new skills such as laser cutting, product testing, and how to work with code and electrical components better. 
I gained a lot of confidence in regards to doing things I didnâ€™t think I could do. Coding in particular.

**Leslie:** How to be a technical lead. Excelling in the design, CAD, manufacturing (laser cutting and 3D printing), 
and mechanical assembly. Also became more experienced at task delegation.
